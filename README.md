### Final Project
# Divorce Prediction
### Motivations for the topic:
- Curious to find out why over 50% of all marriages in the US end up in a divorce or separation.
- What circumstances lead to a divorce? How to take precautions in a holistic way?
- Does occupation, age, race & location play a role in the divorce? 
- Using our Data Analytics & Machine Learning skills we were able to find answers.
- UC Irvine real survey Divorce Predictor data set, our quiz which will predict your divorce rate.
### Challenges in Datasets & Correlations
- Biggest challenge to find a good meaningful sample size with real life surveys.
- Different file formats, .csv,.pdf 
- Training data set vs. The size of the out-of-sample test data set.
- Assuming peopleâ€™s behaviors are similar across diverse backgrounds.
- Unable to extrapolate data sets.
- May result in high variance
